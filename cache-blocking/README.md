# Optimizing matrix multiplication

The file `matmul.cpp` / `matmul.F90` contains a naive implementation of matrix-matrix 
multiplication, which has very inefficient cache usage. Try to improve the performance by

 1. Creating a transposed copy of one of the source matrices. This will allow both right hand
    side matrices in the innermost loop to be traversed contiguously
 2. Implement cache blocking for the computational loop
