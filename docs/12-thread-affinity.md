# Non-uniform memory access

<div class=column>
- A node can have multiple sockets with memory attached to each socket
- Non Uniform Memory Access (NUMA)
    - All memory within a node is accessible, but latencies and bandwidths vary
- Hardware needs to maintain cahce coherency also between different NUMA nodes (ccNUMA)

# First touch policy

- Modern operating systems use virtual memory
- The OS typically optimizes memory allocations
    - `malloc()` does not allocate the memory directly
    - Memory management only “knows” about the allocation, but no memory
      pages are made available
    - At first memory access (write), the OS physically allocates the 
     corresponding page (First touch policy)
- On NUMA systems this might lead to performance issues in threaded 
  or multi-process applications

# NUMA aware initialization


<div class=column>
- No NUMA awareness

```c
// Initialize data
for (int i=0; i < N; i++) 
   data[i] = ...
...
// Perform work
#pragma omp parallel for
for (int i=0; i < N; i++) 
   process(data[i])
```
</div>

# NUMA aware initialization

<div class=column>
- With NUMA awareness

```c
// Initialize data
#pragma omp parallel for
for (int i=0; i < N; i++) 
   data[i] = ...
...
// Perform work
#pragma omp parallel for
for (int i=0; i < N; i++) 
   process(data[i])
```

# Thread and process affinity

- Normally, operating system can run threads and processes in any
  logical core
- Operating system may even move running task from one core to another
    - Can be beneficial for load balancing
    - For HPC workloads often detrimental as private caches get
      invalidated and NUMA locality is lost
- User can control where tasks are run via affinity masks
    - Task can be *pinned* to a specific logical core or set of logical cores

# Controlling affinity

- Affinity for a *process* can be set with a `numactl` command
    - Limit the process to logical cores 0,3,7: 
      <br>
      `numactl --physcpubind=0,3,7 ./my_exe`
    - Threads "inherit" the affinity of their parent process
- Affinity of a thread can be set with OpenMP environment variables
    - `OMP_PLACES=[threads,cores,sockets]`
    - `OMP_PROC_BIND=[true, close, spread, master]`
- OpenMP runtime prints the affinity with `OMP_DISPLAY_AFFINITY=true`

# Controlling affinity

```
export OMP_AFFINITY_FORMAT="Thread %0.3n affinity %A"
export OMP_DISPLAY_AFFINITY=true
./test
Thread 000 affinity 0-7
Thread 001 affinity 0-7
Thread 002 affinity 0-7
Thread 003 affinity 0-7
```


```
OMP_PLACES=cores ./test
Thread 000 affinity 0,4
Thread 001 affinity 1,5
Thread 002 affinity 2,6
Thread 003 affinity 3,7
```



# MPI+OpenMP thread affinity

<div class="column">
- MPI library must be aware of the underlying OpenMP for correct
  allocation of resources
    - Oversubscription of CPU cores may cause significant performance
      penalty
- Additional complexity from batch job schedulers
- Heavily dependent on the platform used!
</div>

# Slurm configuration at CSC

- Within a node, `--tasks-per-node` MPI tasks are spread
  `--cpus-per-task` apart
- Threads within a MPI tasks have the affinity mask for the
  corresponging 
  <br>
  `--cpus-per-task` cores
```
export OMP_AFFINITY_FORMAT="Process %P thread %0.3n affinity %A"
export OMP_DISPLAY_AFFINITY=true
srun ... --tasks-per-node=2 --cpus-per-task=4 ./test
Process 250545 thread 000 affinity 0-3
...
Process 250546 thread 000 affinity 4-7
...
```

- Slurm configurations in other HPC centers can be very different
    - Always experiment before production calculations!
  
# Summary

- Performance of HPC applications is often improved when processes and
threads are pinned to CPU cores
- MPI and batch system configurations may affect the affinity
    - very system dependent, try to always investigate
